# lg_equity_research

Agentic equity research implemented on LangGraph

# Architecture

This app implements an agentic ai architecture to compile equity research on a single stock across different analytical lenses for a given trade duration.
The app exposes a POST endpoint that receives a single stock ticker which serves as the focal point of the research.

The app structures ai agents as research domain specialists that perform data gathering and analysis scoped to their respective domain.
The app manages state through langgraph's graph state model.
Research agents are executed in parallel at the start of the workflow.
When all agents have executed, a aggregator agent synthesizes overall sentiment for the stock.
The graph implements a node-based cache that configures cache keys and ttl at the agent level.
